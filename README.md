# Sector_Stock_Analysis
Sector-level stock analysis using Python: data acquisition, visualization, correlation, and volatility of S&amp;P 500 stocks grouped by sector.

# Project Overview

This project explores sector-level trends and relationships among 50 major stocks from the S&P 500 index. Using Python, the analysis covers:

- Downloading and preparing historical stock price data

- Visualizing adjusted closing prices by sector

- Calculating cumulative returns to compare growth

- Analyzing correlations to understand stock interdependencies

- Measuring volatility via polar bar plots

The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in financial data analysis, visualization, and Python programming, producing recruiter-ready work hosted on GitHub.

# Dataset
Data is sourced via the yfinance library, pulling daily adjusted closing prices from Yahoo Finance for 50 carefully selected tickers representing diverse sectors, including Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Consumer Goods, and Energy.

# Features and Analysis
- Data Acquisition: Automated download of historical stock prices from 2020 to present

- Sector Grouping: Stocks grouped by sector for focused comparative analysis
